    "Since DAZN/TI's content protection scheme requires black/white list processing and signed token validation, both plugins involves spawning inner transactions for country/asn/header lookup and the latter also conducts cryptographic computions, and these protections need to be enforced on all requests (manifests and segments), we are concerned about whether and how these additional operations will negatively impact the performance of (edge) caches"
